I see that look upon your face
Something my mind cannot erase
If we keep staring
then I might have to
Might have to start
to walk your way
I wanna hear
what you would say
You got high standards
and I do too
'Cause all those girls
(They don't)
Know what you need
(They don't)
But I know, I know
the way, the way
To make, to make
sure you never leave
If I come close,
baby, would you like that?
If I give some,
would you give it right back?
If I show you
that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that?
Baby, would you like that?
Say you want love,
boy, I know what that means
Make you feel way
better than in your dreams
If I show you
that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that?
Baby, would you like that?
Yo, it's likе that, like that
How you run it right back
Know you on the right track
Queen, ace, blackjack
I bе thinking way too much
I need to let it go
You be running through my mind
And I'ma let it show
'Cause ain't nobody
stepping up to me
And saying nothing
when I calling you
Be running eye to eye
we never fronting, yeah
We zoning bet we stunting
on and on and on and
To the top, baby boy,
we be rolling
'Cause all those girls
(They don't)
Know what you need
(They don't)
But I know, I know
the way, the way
To make, to make
sure you never leave
If I come close,
baby, would you like that?
If I give some,
would you give it right back?
If I show you
that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that?
Baby, would you like that?
Say you want love,
boy, I know what that means
Make you feel way
better than in your dreams
If I show you
that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that?
Baby, would you like that?
I want you in my arms
In my arms, my arms
(That's where you need to be)
In my arms, in my arms
My arms
(That's where you need to be)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
But I know, I know

To make, to make
sure you never leave
If I come close,
